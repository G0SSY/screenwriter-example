# Screenwriter Example Project
This is the Example Project for the Unreal Engine 4 Plugin Screenwriter. 

The project contains three maps in the "Screenwriter" content folder. 

* CutsceneExample - Contains a single "triggered" cutscene assuming control of an NPC
* DialogueExample - Contains an "approachable" NPC that, when interacted with, intiates a Dialogue that the player participates in.
* InteractiveActExample - A scene with a UI for sending the controlled NPC between a series of points, demonstrating the "Branching" capability of the Plugin.

## Usage
To run this project, you will first need to purchase the Screenwriter plugin from the Unreal Engine Marketplace: [Epic Games Launcher Link](com.epicgames.launcher://ue/marketplace/content/c636fa758b3f4ad29d9f9c4c15c81f02).

The Project was created in Unreal Engine 4.17, and so will be compatible with any version from it onwards. Unfortunately you will need to upgrade from prior versions to use this Project.
