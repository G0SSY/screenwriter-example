# Screenwriter Example Project
This is the Example Project for the Unreal Engine 4 Plugin Screenwriter. 

The project contains four maps in the "Screenwriter" content folder. 

* CutsceneExample - Walk through the Arch to trigger a Cutscene, it assumes control of the NPC, with the player free to move around.
* DialogueExample - Has an approachable NPC that you can interact with, intiating a Dialogue that the player participates in (no longer able to move).
* FirstPersonExample - As above, except from a First Person perspective.
* InteractiveActExample - A more world-coupled scene, giving the player control over an NPC. It can be sent to a series of points, dependent on it's current location. It demonstrates the "Branching" capability of the Plugin more clearly.

## Usage
To run this project, you will first need to purchase the plugin: [Screenwriter - UE4 Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/screenwriter)

The Project is currently maintained in Unreal Engine 4.20. See the Git Repository Tags for previous engine versions, but note that these will not be guaranteed to work.

## Screenwriter Version 2
With the release of UE4.20, Screenwriter has been updated with some breaking changes, please refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/G0SSY/screenwriter-example/wiki/Screenwriter-Version-2-Upgrade) for a guide on how to upgrade. This Project is now dependent on the updated version, so if you haven't got it yet (Check in the UE4 Plugin Manager UI), download the [4.18 version](https://github.com/G0SSY/screenwriter-example/releases/tag/4.18) instead.
